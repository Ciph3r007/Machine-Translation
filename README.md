# Machine-Translation
An English to German machine translation model using tensorflowâ€™s custom layers and custom training loops.

## Architecture
The following is a schematic description of the custom translation model architecture.

This custom model consists of an encoder RNN and a decoder RNN. The encoder takes words of an English sentence as input, and uses a pre-trained word embedding to embed the words into a 128-dimensional space. To indicate the end of the input sentence, a special end token (in the same 128-dimensional space) is passed in as an input. This token is a TensorFlow Variable that is learned in the training phase (unlike the pre-trained word embedding, which is frozen).

The decoder RNN takes the internal state of the encoder network as its initial state. A start token is passed in as the first input, which is embedded using a learned German word embedding. The decoder RNN then makes a prediction for the next German word, which during inference is then passed in as the following input, and this process is repeated until the special `<end>` token is emitted from the decoder.
